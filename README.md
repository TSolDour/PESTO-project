# PESTO-project

Transgenerational effects of early exposure to environmentaly realistic pesticide mixture in the Pacific oyster.

The aim of this project is to understand how environmental pesticide contamination impacts marine organisms like the Pacific oyster, Crassotrea gigas, throughout their life cycle and across generations, when they are exposed during their early development.
We worked on three consecutive generations of oysters proceeding by expose them to a mixture of 18 pesticides at low environmental concentrations for 48 hours after fertilization.
Several endpoints were investigated throughout larval and late development like growth, survival rate, metamorphosis ability, gene expression and DNA methylation at some key stages.

This Git gathers informations about pipelines and scripts used for every analyses. All of the RNAseq and Methylseq data processing were carried out on the Ifremer's cluster Datarmor. The scripts always contain the version of the used tools.
