The methylseq data were obtained from gastrula embryos (6 hours post-fertilization)
and metamorphosis-competent pediveliger larvae (19 or 16 days post-fertilization depending on the generation concerned).

Genomic DNA was extracted using the E.Z.N.A. (R) Mollusk DNA kit by Omega Bio-Tek. Quality controlled DNA unerwent
a NEBNext Enzymatic conversion before to be sequenced (150bp PE reads) on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 plateform.
