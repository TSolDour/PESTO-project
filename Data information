The RNAseq data were obtained from gastrula embryos (6 hours post-fertilization)
and metamorphosis-competent pediveliger larvae (19 or 16 days post-fertilization depending on the generation concerned).

RNA was extracted using a trizol-chloroform protocol and, after quality and purity check,
was sequenced (RNAseq 150bp PE reads) on an Illumina NovaSeq plateform.
